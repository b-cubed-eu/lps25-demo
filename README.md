## Hands-on training description
Room: Room 1.14
Duration: 80 Minutes
Authors: Lina M. Estupinan-Suarez, Henrique Pereira, Lissa Breugelmans, Rocio Beatriz Cortes Lobos, Luise Quoss, Emmanuel Oceguera, Duccio Rocchini, Maarten Trekels, Quentin Groom
This 90-minute hands-on session empowers researchers and biosphere analyst to harness data mobilised by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data for advanced biodiversity analysis. Through active, step-by-step exercises, participants will learn how to create species occurrence cubes using SQL queries, calculate key biodiversity indicators, and convert these outcomes into a standardized geospatial format (EBVCubes) for enhanced ecological monitoring.

### Session Outline:
1. Creating Species Occurrence Cubes (30 minutes including Q&A): Participants will start by extracting and organizing GBIF species occurrence data into structured data cubes using an SQL query. This segment emphasizes practical exercises, allowing attendees to work with real data and receive one-on-one guidance.
2. Ecological Modeling and Simulated Data Cubes (30 minutes including Q&A):
This part of the session will demonstrate how Virtual Suitability Data cubes can be generated and used in modeling workflows. Participants will explore a data structure that can be useful for analyzing changes in suitability of multiple species across time and space
3. Converting to Standard Geospatial Data (30 minutesin including Q&A): In the final segment, the outcomes from the previous steps will be transformed into EBVCubesâ€”a standardized geo-spatial data format tailored for biodiversity applications. This ensures that the results are readily applicable for further analysis and decision-making.
Participants will gain hands-on expertise in biodiversity data processing and a deeper understanding of how integrative data facilities can bridge the gap between Earth observation and biodiversity research. This enriched perspective is critical for developing informed conservation strategies and policies in response to the complex challenges posed by the intertwined crises of biodiversity loss and climate change.
