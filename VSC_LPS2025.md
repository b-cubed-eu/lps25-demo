# Virtual Suitability Data Cube Tutorial

Species suitability refers to **how favorable** an environment is for a species to survive, reproduce, and grow in a specific area and time. It considers factors like climate, landscape, and resource availability.

**Species Distribution Models** (SDMs) are tools that use environmental and species occurrence data to study and predict the distribution of species across time and space. SDMs help identify **suitable habitats**, forecast the movements of invasive species, and illustrate how species distributions might change due to climate change. They are essential for conservation planning and biodiversity protection.

Studying species suitability under different environmental conditions is crucial for understanding population dynamics, planning conservation actions, and monitoring the effects of climate change and human activities. With this knowledge, we can make better decisions to protect habitats and species sustainably.

To observe species suitability over multiple species and time periods, we developed a framework using **data cubes** — multidimensional arrays that organize data in a structured way. In **R**, the [`stars`](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) package provides a convenient way to represent these cubes.

A `stars` object allows for three or more dimensions — in our case:
- **Time** (e.g., 2020 and 2070)
- **Space** (represented by grid cells or polygons)
- **Species** (virtual species with defined ecological preferences)

Each cell in the cube contains a value of **suitability**, which we calculate by combining climate data with species-specific response functions.

### What are `stars` objects?
`stars` objects are multidimensional arrays with spatial (and optionally temporal) structure. They allow for:
- **Slicing** across dimensions (e.g., extracting a time step or species)
- **Aggregation** (e.g., averaging suitability over time or space)
- **Visualization** using base R or `ggplot2`

### Tutorial Overview
In this tutorial, we:
1. Download **bioclimatic variables** for South Africa from WorldClim (current) and CMIP6 (future).
2. Select three relevant variables: annual mean temperature (`bio1`), annual precipitation (`bio12`), and precipitation seasonality (`bio15`).
3. Define response curves for **three virtual species**, each with distinct ecological preferences.
4. Generate **suitability maps** for each species under both present (2020) and future (2070) climate conditions.
5. Create a **spatial grid** (as polygons) over the study area.
6. Aggregate the suitability values over this grid.
7. Combine all layers into a **`stars` data cube** with dimensions:
   - **cell**: spatial polygons (grid)
   - **species**: species_1, species_2, species_3
   - **time**: 2020, 2070
8. Visualize the cube using `ggplot2`.

This structured data format makes it easy to observe changes in species suitability over space and time, and lays the foundation for more advanced modeling workflows (e.g., validation, ensemble modeling, thresholding).

---

The code implementation follows this exact logic, using `terra`, `virtualspecies`, `sf`, and `stars`. Virtual species are particularly useful for this demonstration because their ecological preferences are defined explicitly, making them ideal for controlled experiments or teaching. Each virtual species is associated with a response to climate variables, and we use these responses to compute suitability scores across the landscape.

The final output is a unified, three-dimensional `stars` object that is well suited for exploratory analysis, visualization, and integration into biodiversity decision-support tools.
